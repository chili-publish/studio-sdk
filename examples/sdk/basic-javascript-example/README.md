# Basic Vanilla Javascript SDK example

In this example, the SDK gets initialised in the most simple form.
It loads in the SDK without any packagemanager, just as a script from our CDN endpoint, using always the latest version in the process.

## How to run

This basic application should be run inside a local webserver like Apache, NGINX or MAMP.
Otherwise there might be some issues regarding fetching the document and so on.

Apart from that, it's just a matter of opening up the html file, since this is a vanilla JS example, there is no need to build or transpile anything.
