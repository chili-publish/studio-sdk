# Basic Vanilla Javascript SDK example

In this example, the SDK gets initialised in the most simple form.
It loads in the SDK without via a packagemanager. This could be either `npm` or `yarn`.

simply run `npm install @chili-publish/studio-sdk --save` and you're good to go.

\*\* note that this example uses a local reference to the package so that needs to be changed first

## How to run

This basic application should be run inside a local webserver like Apache, NGINX or MAMP.
Otherwise there might be some issues regarding fetching the document and so on.

Apart from that, it's just a matter of opening up the html file, since this is a vanilla JS example, there is no need to build or transpile anything.
