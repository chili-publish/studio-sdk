# Communication guidelines

## Availability

We pledge to do our absolute best to respond to newly opened issues within 48 hours during business hours. It is the responsibility of the CHILI publish ReactJS team to try to stick to this response time.

## Organization and repository structure

All our repositories are housed within [the @chili-publish GitHub organization](https://github.com/chili-publish).

## Maintainer responsibilities

### Identifying maintainers, contributors, and the general public

When interacting in a repository owned by the CHILI publish organization, you are speaking on behalf of the company.

Employees are identified with an OWNER badge.

Community members with prior contributions will be identified with a CONTRIBUTOR badge, and those without prior contributions will not have a badge.

### Enforcing to the code of conduct

Our [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) outlines the behavior we expect from our community. Maintainers are responsible for enforcing violations they witness, or those that have been reported to coc@chili-publish.com.

Violations are not tolerated, but there are always some gray areas.

-   **All incidents** are logged. This ensures gray areas do not escalate to a violation without the awareness of all maintainers.
-   **Indirect violations or gray areas** can usually be addressed with a warning. Send the user a direct message if possible. If the violation occurred in an issue, pull request, or other public space, you should respond publicly as well. It is important that all community members see violations are not tolerated.
-   **Direction violations** require action immediately. This may include removing an offensive comment, [blocking the user](https://help.github.com/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization/) from our organization, and [reporting them to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/reporting-abuse-or-spam/) directly.
