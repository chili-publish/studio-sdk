/**
 * @experimental This controller is still experimental and might change in future releases.
 *
 * The ComponentConnectorController is responsible for all communication regarding Component connectors.
 * Methods inside this controller can be called by `window.SDK.ComponentConnector.{method-name}`
 *
 * The way GraFx Studio handles different sources of Component is called 'ComponentConnector'.
 * A ComponentConnector is an implementation of a set of capabilities we need
 * to interact with a certain Component Asset Management system.
 * In essence, a connector is the combination of a JavaScript snippet and some metadata.
 * The JavaScript snippet is loaded in the studio engine using a sandboxed JavaScript execution engine (QuickJs).
 * This allows us to execute the Component connector
 * both on web using webassembly and on the server side during output generation.
 * This controller is an interface to the running connector instance inside the studio engine.
