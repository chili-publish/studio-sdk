## Overview

This repository includes the editor-sdk, the SDK is used to plugin to the CHILI publisher API and will handle the communication between integrations (workspace, etc) and editor engine.

The goal for the SDK is to be as lightweight as possible. We don’t want to store state in here, that would be hard to maintain and keep in sync with the engine. In general the SDK is an abstraction layer for the editor engine, providing a fixed API for the integrators, and flexibility for the engine to evolve.

Conceptually you can think of the SDK - Editor Engine relation as a client - server relation. The SDK will issue requests to the engine and expects a certain result. The other way around the analogy with WebSockets could be used to define how data flows from the engine to the SDK (and eventually consumers of the SDK).

## Getting started

There are 2 ways of getting the SDK.

### NPM (with TS support)

The most easy approach would be installing it using a package manager like `npm` or `yarn` just do:

```bash
npm install --save @chili-publish/editor-sdk
```

or

```bash
yarn add @chili-publish/editor-sdk
```

Then you can easily import the SDK in your JS and TS files, but also the typing is included with this approach.

```typescript
// TS example
import EditorSDK from '@chili-publish/editor-sdk';
import type { Variable } from '@chili-publish/editor-sdk';
```

### Load script

The other way would be to include the sdk using the script tag just before the closure. of the body.

```html
<script src="https://path/to/sdk/latest/main.js"></script>
```

To really get started, there is a nice guide on [the official documentation page](https://chili-publish.github.io/editor-sdk/).
And you can find basic integration examples in [one of our other repositories](https://github.com/chili-publish/editor-sdk-integration-examples).

## Build documentation

After installing all dependencies, you're able to build the typedoc documentation. You only need to run the following command

```bash
npx typedoc --hideBreadcrumbs
```
